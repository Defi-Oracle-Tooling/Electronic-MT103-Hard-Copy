	•	SWIFT Standards (ISO 15022 & ISO 20022) – Defines formatting and data fields for secure cross-border transactions.
	•	Financial Action Task Force (FATF) AML & CTF Guidelines – Ensures anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) compliance.
	•	Basel III Framework – Mandates proper risk management for international banking transactions.

2. Steps to Prepare and Submit an MT103 Hard Copy

A. Preparation of MT103 Document
	1.	Ensure Data Accuracy – Verify that all transaction details (sender, receiver, intermediary banks, amounts, and reference numbers) are correctly formatted according to SWIFT MT103 message structure.
	2.	Bank Verification – Confirm that all parties involved are compliant with Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML/CFT regulations.
	3.	Attach Supporting Documents:
	•	Proof of Funds (POF) – Ensures the transaction is backed by legitimate sources.
	•	KYC/AML Clearance – Issued by the originating bank.
	•	Letter of Intent (LOI) – From the sender or beneficiary stating the purpose of the transaction.
	•	Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) – If required, confirming the authenticity of the sender’s account.

B. Formatting the MT103 Hard Copy

The hard copy must follow SWIFT-compliant structure, which includes:
	1.	Message Type (MT103)
	2.	Sender & Receiver Bank Details (BIC/SWIFT Codes)
	3.	Intermediary Bank (if applicable)
	4.	Transaction Amount and Currency
	5.	Value Date & Transaction Reference
	6.	Purpose of Payment
	7.	Regulatory Compliance Notes

C. Delivery of Hard Copy to Government Authorities
	1.	Notarization & Authentication
	•	Secure notarization from a licensed financial attorney or bank compliance officer.
	•	Obtain a Chamber of Commerce authentication stamp (if required by local regulations).
	•	If Swaziland (Eswatini) and Mozambique require Apostille certification, this should be arranged through The Hague Convention authentication process.
	2.	Submission to Government Entities
	•	Deliver a sealed and signed hard copy to designated financial officials or the Central Bank of Eswatini and Banco de Moçambique.
	•	Ensure acknowledgment of receipt with a tracking reference.
	3.	Bank & Regulator Notification
	•	Provide a digital version of the hard copy MT103 to the receiving financial institution for pre-validation.
	•	Coordinate with the respective Central Banks to confirm their acceptance and regulatory processing timeline.

3. Additional Compliance Considerations
	•	Sanctions & Blacklist Screening – Ensure neither sender nor receiver appears on OFAC, EU, UN, or FATF blacklists.
	•	Cross-Border Tax & Reporting – Transactions above thresholds set by OECD, FATF, or domestic financial laws may require automatic exchange of information (AEOI) filings.
	•	Secure Delivery – If required, the document should be couriered via a secure financial document delivery service (e.g., DHL Secure Transport, Brinks Global Services).
