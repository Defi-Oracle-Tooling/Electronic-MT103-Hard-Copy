# AI Integration with GitHub Copilot

This document describes how the MT103 system integrates GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities to enhance message processing and compliance validation.

## Overview

Our system leverages GitHub Copilot's agent capabilities to provide intelligent assistance for:

- MT103 message completion and formatting
- Compliance and regulatory validation
- Anomaly detection in transaction patterns
- Document generation for audit and reporting

## Setup Requirements

To use the AI integration features, you'll need:

1. A GitHub Copilot subscription with API access
2. An API key configured as an environment variable
3. The AI integration module installed

### Environment Configuration

Set up your environment with:

```bash
export GITHUB_COPILOT_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

For production systems, store this securely in Azure Key Vault or similar service.

## API Endpoints

### Enhance MT103 Messages

```http

}
```

**Response:**

```json

  "beneficiaryAccount": "US7630006000011234567890189",
  "reference": "INV-20240501-001"
}
```

### Validate Compliance

```http
POST /api/v1/mt103/ai/validate-compliance
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token

{
  "messageId": "EXAMPLE20240501001",
  "senderBIC": "BANKFRPPXXX",
  "amount": 50000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "beneficiaryName": "ACME Corp",
  "beneficiaryAccount": "US7630006000011234567890189"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "isCompliant": true,
  "regulations": ["AML", "FATF", "SWIFT", "BSA"],
  "issues": [],
  "riskScore": 0.2,
  "explanation": "Transaction appears to be a standard commercial payment with known entities and within normal parameters."
}
```

## Security Considerations

Our AI integration implements these security measures:

1. **Rate Limiting:** Restricts the number of AI requests per minute
2. **Audit Logging:** Records all AI interactions for compliance purposes
3. **Data Minimization:** Only sends necessary data to the AI service
4. **Human Review:** High-risk transactions are flagged for human review

## Example Use Cases

### Automated Message Completion

When users start drafting an MT103 message but leave fields blank, the system can suggest appropriate values based on:

- Historical patterns for the sender/receiver
- Typical transaction parameters
- Compliance requirements

### Compliance Monitoring

The AI continuously monitors transactions for:

- Unusual patterns that might indicate money laundering
- Transactions with sanctioned entities or regions
- Structured transactions designed to evade reporting thresholds

### Document Generation

Generate compliant documentation for:

- Audit trails
- Regulatory reports
- Customer communications

## Future Enhancements

We plan to extend AI capabilities to include:

- Predictive analytics for transaction forecasting
- Natural language query interface for transaction research
- Multi-lingual support for international compliance requirements
