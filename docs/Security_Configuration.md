# Security Configuration

This document outlines the security configurations and best practices implemented in the Electronic MT103 Hard Copy system.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Azure Active Directory

The system uses Azure AD for authentication with the following configuration:

- Multi-factor authentication required for all administrative access
- Conditional access policies enforced for sensitive operations
- Role-based access control implemented for MT103 processing

### API Security

- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Scope-based permissions
- Rate limiting configured to prevent abuse

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- All data encrypted at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption
- All data in transit encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- Database columns with sensitive information use Always Encrypted

### Key Management

- Azure Key Vault used for secret storage
- Key rotation policy: 90 days
- HSM-backed keys for production

## Network Security

- Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled
- Network Security Groups restrict traffic
- Private endpoints for internal services
- IP restrictions for administrative access

## Compliance Controls

- Audit logs retained for 7 years
- SWIFT message integrity validation
- Data sovereignty measures implemented for international transfers

## Monitoring and Detection

- Azure Security Center alerts configured
- Custom detection rules for suspicious patterns
- Log Analytics workspace with saved queries for compliance reporting

## Incident Response

In case of security incidents:

1. Contact: security@example.com
2. Secondary contact: +1-555-123-4567
3. Follow the [Incident Response Plan](./compliance/incident_response.md)

## Security Testing

- Automated security scans on each deployment
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual comprehensive security review
