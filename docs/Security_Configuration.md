# Security Configuration Guide

## GitHub Secrets

The following secrets are configured in the repository:

- `SONAR_TOKEN`: Authentication token for SonarQube analysis
- `SONAR_HOST_URL`: URL of the SonarQube instance

### Secret Management

- Secrets are stored securely in GitHub repository settings
- Never commit tokens or credentials to the codebase
- Rotate tokens periodically according to security policy
- Use environment-specific secrets for different deployments

## Access Control

- Only repository administrators can manage secrets
- Secrets are encrypted at rest
- Secrets are masked in workflow logs
